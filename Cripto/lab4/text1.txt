CHAPTER 1
After the Flood 1957
1
The terror which would not end for another twentyeight yearsif it ever did endbegan so far as I know or can tell with a boat made from a sheet of newspaper floating down a gutter swollen with rain
The boat bobbed listed righted itself again dived bravely through treacherous whirlpools and continued on its way down Witcham Street toward the traffic light which marked the intersection of Witcham and Jackson The three vertical lenses on all sides of the traffic light were dark this afternoon in the fall of 1957 and the houses were all dark too There had been steady rain for a week now and two days ago the winds had come as well Most sections of Derry had lost their power then and it was not back on yet
A small boy in a yellow slicker and red galoshes ran cheerfully along beside the newspaper boat The rain had not stopped but it was finally slackening It tapped on the yellow hood of the boys slicker sounding to his ears like rain on a shed roof  a comfortable almost cozy sound The boy in the yellow slicker was George Denbrough He was six His brother William known to most of the kids at Derry Elementary School and even to the teachers who would never have used the nickname to his face as Stuttering Bill was at home hacking out the last of a nasty case of influenza In that autumn of 1957 eight months before the real horrors began and twentyeight years before the final showdown Stuttering Bill was ten years old
Bill had made the boat beside which George now ran He had made it sitting up in bed his back propped against a pile of pillows while their mother played Für Elise on the piano in the parlor and rain swept restlessly against his bedroom window
About threequarters of the way down the block as one headed toward the intersection and the dead traffic light Witcham Street was blocked to motor traffic by smudgepots and four orange sawhorses Stencilled across each of the horses was DERRY DEPT OF PUBLIC WORKS Beyond them the rain had spilled out of gutters clogged with branches and rocks and big sticky piles of autumn leaves The water had first pried fingerholds in the paving and then snatched whole greedy handfulsall of this by the third day of the rains By noon of the fourth day big chunks of the streets surface were boating through the intersection of Jackson and Witcham like miniature whitewater rafts By that time many people in Derry had begun to make nervous jokes about arks The Public Works Department had managed to keep Jackson Street open but Witcham was impassable from the sawhorses all the way to the center of town
But everyone agreed the worst was over The Kenduskeag Stream had crested just below its banks in the Barrens and bare inches below the concrete sides of the Canal which channelled it tightly as it passed through downtown Right now a gang of menZack Denbrough Georges and Bills father among themwere removing the sandbags they had thrown up the day before with such panicky haste Yesterday overflow and expensive flood damage had seemed almost inevitable God knew it had happened beforethe flooding in 1931 had been a disaster which had cost millions of dollars and almost two dozen lives That was a long time ago but there were still enough people around who remembered it to scare the rest One of the flood victims had been found twentyfive miles east in Bucksport The fish had eaten this unfortunate gentlemans eyes three of his fingers his penis and most of his left foot Clutched in what remained of his hands had been a Ford steering wheel
Now though the river was receding and when the new Bangor Hydro dam went in upstream the river would cease to be a threat Or so said Zack Denbrough who worked for Bangor Hydroelectric As for the restwell future floods could take care of themselves The thing was to get through this one to get the power back on and then to forget it In Derry such forgetting of tragedy and disaster was almost an art as Bill Denbrough would come to discover in the course of time
George paused just beyond the sawhorses at the edge of a deep ravine that had been cut through the tar surface of Witcham Street This ravine ran on an almost exact diagonal It ended on the far side of the street roughly forty feet farther down the hill from where he now stood on the right He laughed aloudthe sound of solitary childish glee a bright runner in that gray afternoonas a vagary of the flowing water took his paper boat into a scalemodel rapids which had been formed by the break in the tar The urgent water had cut a channel which ran along the diagonal and so his boat travelled from one side of Witcham Street to the other the current carrying it so fast that George had to sprint to keep up with it Water sprayed out from beneath his galoshes in muddy sheets Their buckles made a jolly jingling as George Denbrough ran toward his strange death And the feeling which filled him at that moment was clear and simple love for his brother Bill  love and a touch of regret that Bill couldnt be here to see this and be a part of it Of course he would try to describe it to Bill when he got home but he knew he wouldnt be able to make Bill see it the way Bill would have been able to make him see it if their positions had been reversed Bill was good at reading and writing but even at his age George was wise enough to know that wasnt the only reason why Bill got all As on his report cards or why his teachers liked his compositions so well Telling was only part of it Bill was good at seeing
The boat nearly whistled along the diagonal channel just a page torn from the Classified section of the Derry News but now George imagined it as a PT boat in a war movie like the ones he sometimes saw down at the Derry Theater with Bill at Saturday matinees A war picture with John Wayne fighting the Japs The prow of the newspaper boat threw sprays of water to either side as it rushed along and then it reached the gutter on the left side of Witcham Street A fresh streamlet rushed over the break in the tar at this point creating a fairly large whirlpool and it seemed to him that the boat must be swamped and capsize It leaned alarmingly and then George cheered as it righted itself turned and went racing on down toward the intersection George sprinted to catch up Over his head a grim gust of October wind rattled the trees now almost completely unburdened of their freight of colored leaves by the storm which had been this year a reaper of the most ruthless sort
2
Sitting up in bed his cheeks still flushed with heat but his fever like the Kenduskeag finally receding Bill had finished the boatbut when George reached for it Bill held it out of reach NNow get me the ppparaffin
Whats that Where is it
Its on the cellar shuhshuhshelf as you go ddownstairs Bill said In a box that says GuhGuhhulf    Gulf Bring that to me and a knife and a bbowl And a puhpack of muhmuhmatches
George had gone obediently to get these things He could hear his mother playing the piano not Für Elise now but something else he didnt like so wellsomething that sounded dry and fussy he could hear rain flicking steadily against the kitchen windows These were comfortable sounds but the thought of the cellar was not a bit comfortable He did not like the cellar and he did not like going down the cellar stairs because he always imagined there was something down there in the dark That was silly of course his father said so and his mother said so and even more important Bill said so but still
He did not even like opening the door to flick on the light because he always had the ideathis was so exquisitely stupid he didnt dare tell anyonethat while he was feeling for the light switch some horrible clawed paw would settle lightly over his wrist  and then jerk him down into the darkness that smelled of dirt and wet and dim rotted vegetables
Stupid There were no things with claws all hairy and full of killing spite Every now and then someone went crazy and killed a lot of peoplesometimes Chet Huntley told about such things on the evening newsand of course there were Commies but there was no weirdo monster living down in their cellar Still this idea lingered In those interminable moments while he was groping for the switch with his right hand his left arm curled around the doorjamb in a deathgrip that cellar smell seemed to intensify until it filled the world Smells of dirt and wet and longgone vegetables would merge into one unmistakable ineluctable smell the smell of the monster the apotheosis of all monsters It was the smell of something for which he had no name the smell of It crouched and lurking and ready to spring A creature which would eat anything but which was especially hungry for boymeat
He had opened the door that morning and had groped interminably for the switch holding the jamb in his usual deathgrip his eyes squinched shut the tip of his tongue poked from the corner of his mouth like an agonized rootlet searching for water in a place of drought Funny Sure You betcha Lookit you Georgie Georgies scared of the dark What a baby
The sound of the piano came from what his father called the living room and what his mother called the parlor It sounded like music from another world far away the way talk and laughter on a summercrowded beach must sound to an exhausted swimmer who struggles with the undertow
His fingers found the switch Ah
They snapped it
and nothing No light
Oh cripes The power
George snatched his arm back as if from a basket filled with snakes He stepped back from the open cellar door his heart hurrying in his chest The power was out of coursehe had forgotten the power was out Jeezlycrow What now Go back and tell Bill he couldnt get the box of paraffin because the power was out and he was afraid that something might get him as he stood on the cellar stairs something that wasnt a Commie or a mass murderer but a creature much worse than either That it would simply slither part of its rotted self up between the stair risers and grab his ankle That would go over big wouldnt it Others might laugh at such a fancy but Bill wouldnt laugh Bill would be mad Bill would say Grow up Georgie  do you want this boat or not
As if this thought were his cue Bill called from his bedroom Did you dddie out there JuhGeorgie
No Im gettin it Bill George called back at once He rubbed at his arms trying to make the guilty gooseflesh disappear and be smooth skin again I just stopped to get a drink of water
Well hhurry up
So be walked down the four steps to the cellar shelf his heart a warm beating hammer in his throat the hair on the nape of his neck standing at attention his eyes hot his hands cold sure that at any moment the cellar door would swing shut on its own closing off the white light falling through the kitchen windows and then he would hear It something worse than all the Commies and murderers in the world worse than the Japs worse than Attila the Hun worse than the somethings in a hundred horror movies It growling deeplyhe would hear the growl in those lunatic seconds before it pounced on him and unzipped his guts
The cellarsmell was worse than ever today because of the flood Their house was high on Witcham Street near the crest of the hill and they had escaped the worst of it but there was still standing water down there that had seeped in through the old rock foundations The smell was low and unpleasant making you want to take only the shallowest breaths
George sifted through the junk on the shelf as fast as he coutdold cans of Kiwi shoepolish and shoepolish rags a broken kerosene lamp two mostly empty bottles of Windex an old flat can of Turtle wax For some reason this can struck him and he spent nearly thirty seconds looking at the turtle on the lid with a kind of hypnotic wonder Then he tossed it back  and here it was at last a square box with the word GULF on it
George snatched it and ran up the stairs as fast as he could suddenly aware that his shirttail was out and suddenly sure that his shirttail would be his undoing the thing in the cellar would allow him to get almost all the way out and then it would grab the tail of his shirt and snatch him back and
He reached the kitchen and swept the door shut behind him It banged gustily He leaned back against it with his eyes closed sweat popped out on his arms and forehead the box of paraffin gripped tightly in one hand
The piano had come to a stop and his moms voice floated to him Georgie cant you slam that door a little harder next time Maybe you could break some of the plates in the Welsh dresser if you really tried
Sorry Mom he called back
Georgie you waste Bill said from his bedroom He pitched his voice low so their mother would not hear
George snickered a little His fear was already gone it had slipped away from him as easily as a nightmare slips away from a man who awakes coldskinned and gasping from its grip who feels his body and stares at his surroundings to make sure that none of it ever happened and who then begins at once to forget it Half is gone by the time his feet hit the floor threequarters of it by the time he emerges from the shower and begins to towel off all of it by the time he finishes his breakfast All gone  until the next time when in the grip of the nightmare all fears will be remembered
That turtle George thought going to the counter drawer where the matches were kept Where did I see a turtle like that before
But no answer came and he dismissed the question
He got a pack of matches from the drawer a knife from the rack holding the sharp edge studiously away from his body as his dad had taught him and a small bowl from the Welsh dresser in the dining room Then he went back into Bills room
WWhat an ahole you are JuhGeorgie Bill said amiably enough and pushed back some of the sickstuff on his nighttable an empty glass a pitcher of water Kleenex books a bottle of Vicks VapoRubthe smell of which Bill would associate all his life with thick phlegmy chests and snotty noses The old Philco radio was there too playing not Chopin or Bach but a Little Richard tune  very softly however so softly that Little Richard was robbed of all his raw and elemental power Their mother who had studied classical piano at Juilliard hated rock and roll She did not merely dislike it she abominated it
Im no ahole George said sitting on the edge of Bills bed and putting the things he had gathered on the nighttable
Yes you are Bill said Nothing but a great big brown ahole thats you
George tried to imagine a kid who was nothing but a great big ahole on legs and began to giggle
Your ahole is bigger than Augusta Bill said beginning to giggle too
Your ahole is bigger than the whole state George replied This broke both boys up for nearly two minutes
There followed a whispered conversation of the sort which means very little to anyone save small boys accusations of who was the biggest ahole who had the biggest ahole which ahole was the brownest and so on Finally Bill said one of the forbidden wordshe accused George of being a big brown shitty aholeand they both got laughing hard Bills laughter turned into a coughing fit As it finally began to taper off by then Bills face had gone a plummy shade which George regarded with some alarm the piano stopped again They both looked in the direction of the parlor listening for the pianobench to scrape back listening for their mothers impatient footsteps Bill buried his mouth in the crook of his elbow stifling the last of the coughs pointing at the pitcher at the same time George poured him a glass of water which he drank off
The piano began once moreFür Elise again Stuttering Bill never forgot that piece and even many years later it never failed to bring gooseflesh to his arms and back his heart would drop and he would remember My mother was playing that the day Georgie died
You gonna cough anymore Bill
No
Bill pulled a Kleenex from the box made a rumbling sound in his chest spat phlegm into the tissue screwed it up and tossed it into the wastebasket by his bed which was filled with similar twists of tissue Then he opened the box of paraffin and dropped a waxy cube of the stuff into his palm George watched him closely but without speaking or questioning Bill didnt like George talking to him while he did stuff but George had learned that if he just kept his mouth shut Bill would usually explain what he was doing
Bill used the knife to cut off a small piece of the paraffin cube He put the piece in the bowl then struck a match and put it on top of the paraffin The two boys watched the small yellow flame as the dying wind drove rain against the window in occasional spatters
Got to waterproof the boat or itll just get wet and sink Bill said When he was with George his stutter was lightsometimes he didnt stutter at all In school however it could become so bad that talking became impossible for him Communication would cease and Bills schoolmates would look somewhere else while Bill clutched the sides of his desk his face growing almost as red as his hair his eyes squeezed into slits as he tried to winch some word out of his stubborn throat Sometimesmost timesthe word would come Other times it simply refused He had been hit by a car when he was three and knocked into the side of a building he had remained unconscious for seven hours Mom said it was that accident which had caused the stutter George sometimes got the feeling that his dadand Bill himselfwas not so sure
The piece of paraffin in the bowl was almost entirely melted The matchflame guttered lower growing blue as it hugged the cardboard stick and then it went out Bill dipped his finger into the liquid jerked it out with a faint hiss He smiled apologetically at George Hot he said After a few seconds he dipped his finger in again and began to smear the wax along the sides of the boat where it quickly dried to a milky haze
Can I do some George asked
Okay Just dont get any on the blankets or Momll kill you
George dipped his finger into the paraffin which was now very warm but no longer hot and began to spread it along the other side of the boat
Dont put on so much you ahole Bill said You want to sink it on its mmaiden cruise
Im sorry
Thats all right Just ggo easy
George finished the other side then held the boat in his hands It felt a little heavier but not much Too cool he said Im gonna go out and sail it
Yeah you do that Bill said He suddenly looked tiredtired and still not very well
I wish you could come George said He really did Bill sometimes got bossy after awhile but he always had the coolest ideas and he hardly ever hit Its your boat really
She Bill said You call boats shshe
She then
I wish I could come too Bill said glumly
Well  George shifted from one foot to the other the boat in his hands
You put on your rainstuff Bill said or youll wind up with the fluhhu like me Probably catch it anyway from my juhgerms
Thanks Bill Its a neat boat And he did something he hadnt done for a long time something Bill never forgot he leaned over and kissed his brothers cheek
Youll catch it for sure now you ahole Bill said but he seemed cheered up all the same He smiled at George Put all this stuff back too Or Momll have a bbird
Sure He gathered up the waterproofing equipment and crossed the room the boat perched precariously on top of the paraffin box which was sitting askew in the little bowl
JuhJuhGeorgie
George turned back to look at his brother
Be ccareful
Sure His brow creased a little That was something your Mom said not your big brother It was as strange as him giving Bill a kiss Sure I will
He went out Bill never saw him again
3
Now here he was chasing his boat down the left side of Witcham Street He was running fast but the water was running faster and his boat was pulling ahead He heard a deepening roar and saw that fifty yards farther down the hill the water in the gutter was cascading into a stormdrain that was still open It was a long dark semicircle cut into the curbing and as George watched a stripped branch its bark as dark and glistening as sealskin shot into the stormdrains maw It hung up there for a moment and then slipped down inside That was where his boat was headed
Oh shit and Shinola he yelled dismayed
He put on speed and for a moment he thought he would catch the boat Then one of his feet slipped and he went sprawling skinning one knee and crying out in pain From his new pavementlevel perspective he watched his boat swing around twice momentarily caught in another whirlpool and then disappear
Shit and Shinola he yelled again and slammed his fist down on the pavement That hurt too and he began to cry a little What a stupid way to lose the boat
He got up and walked over to the stormdrain He dropped to his knees and peered in The water made a dank hollow sound as it fell into the darkness It was a spooky sound It reminded him of
Huh The sound was jerked out of him as if on a string and he recoiled
There were yellow eyes in there the sort of eyes he had always imagined but never actually seen down in the basement Its an animal he thought incoherently thats all it is some animal maybe a housecat that got stuck down in there
Still he was ready to runwould run in a second or two when his mental switchboard had dealt with the shock those two shiny yellow eyes had given him He felt the rough surface of the macadam under his fingers and the thin sheet of cold water flowing around them He saw himself getting up and backing away and that was when a voicea perfectly reasonable and rather pleasant voicespoke to him from inside the stormdrain
Hi Georgie it said
George blinked and looked again He could barely credit what he saw it was like something from a madeup story or a movie where you know the animals will talk and dance If he had been ten years older he would not have believed what he was seeing but he was not sixteen He was six
There was a clown in the stormdrain The light in there was far from good but it was good enough so that George Denbrough was sure of what he was seeing It was a clown like in the circus or on TV In fact he looked like a cross between Bozo and Clarabell who talked by honking his or was it herGeorge was never really sure of the gender horn on Howdy Doody Saturday morningsBuffalo Bob was just about the only one who could understand Clarabell and that always cracked George up The face of the clown in the stormdrain was white there were funny tufts of red hair on either side of his bald head and there was a big clownsmile painted over his mouth If George had been inhabiting a later year he would have surely thought of Ronald McDonald before Bozo or Clarabell
The clown held a bunch of balloons all colors like gorgeous ripe fruit in one hand
In the other he held Georges newspaper boat
Want your boat Georgie The clown smiled
George smiled back He couldnt help it it was the kind of smile you just had to answer I sure do he said
The clown laughed I sure do Thats good Thats very good And how about a balloon
Well    sure He reached forward  and then drew his hand reluctantly back Im not supposed to take stuff from strangers My dad said so
Very wise of your dad the clown in the stormdrain said smiling How George wondered could I have thought his eyes were yellow They were a bright dancing blue the color of his moms eyes and Bills Very wise indeed Therefore I will introduce myself I Georgie am Mr Bob Gray also known as Pennywise the Dancing Clown Pennywise meet George Denbrough George meet Pennywise And now we know each other Im not a stranger to you and youre not a stranger to me Keerect
George giggled I guess so He reached forward again    and drew his hand back again How did you get down there Storm just bleeeew me away Pennywise the Dancing Clown said It blew the whole circus away Can you smell the circus Georgie
George leaned forward Suddenly he could smell peanuts Hot roasted peanuts And vinegar The white kind you put on your french fries through a hole in the cap He could smell cotton candy and frying doughboys and the faint but thunderous odor of wildanimal shit He could smell the cheery aroma of midway sawdust And yet 
And yet under it all was the smell of flood and decomposing leaves and dark stormdrain shadows That smell was wet and rotten The cellarsmell
But the other smells were stronger
You bet I can smell it he said
Want your boat Georgie Pennywise asked I only repeat myself because you really do not seem that eager He held it up smiling He was wearing a baggy silk suit with great big orange buttons A bright tie electricblue flopped down his front and on his hands were big white gloves like the kind Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck always wore
Yes sure George said looking into the stormdrain
And a balloon Ive got red and green and yellow and blue   
Do they float
Float The clowns grin widened Oh yes indeed they do They float And theres cotton candy   
George reached
The clown seized his arm
And George saw the clowns face change
What he saw then was terrible enough to make his worst imaginings of the thing in the cellar look like sweet dreams what he saw destroyed his sanity in one clawing stroke
They float the thing in the drain crooned in a clotted chuckling voice It held Georges arm in its thick and wormy grip it pulled George toward that terrible darkness where the water rushed and roared and bellowed as it bore its cargo of storm debris toward the sea George craned his neck away from that final blackness and began to scream into the rain to scream mindlessly into the white autumn sky which curved above Derry on that day in the fall of 1957 His screams were shrill and piercing and all up and down Witcham Street people came to their windows or bolted out onto their porches
They float it growled they float Georgie and when youre down here with me youll float too
Georges shoulder socked against the cement of the curb and Dave Gardener who had stayed home from his job at The Shoeboat that day because of the flood saw only a small boy in a yellow rainslicker a small boy who was screaming and writhing in the gutter with muddy water surfing over his face and making his screams sound bubbly
Everything down here floats that chuckling rotten voice whispered and suddenly there was a ripping noise and a flaring sheet of agony and George Denbrough knew no more
Dave Gardener was the first to get there and although he arrived only fortyfive seconds after the first scream George Denbrough was already dead Gardener grabbed him by the back of the slicker pulled him into the street    and began to scream himself as Georges body turned over in his hands The left side of Georges slicker was now bright red Blood flowed into the stormdrain from the tattered hole where the left arm had been A knob of bone horribly bright peeked through the torn cloth
The boys eyes stared up into the white sky and as Dave staggered away toward the others already running pellmell down the street they began to fill up with rain
4
Somewhere below in the stormdrain that was already filled nearly to capacity with runoff there could have been no one down there the County Sheriff would later exclaim to a Derry News reporter with a frustrated fury so great it was almost agony Hercules himself would have been swept away in that driving current Georges newspaper boat shot onward through nighted chambers and long concrete hallways that roared and chimed with water For awhile it ran neckandneck with a dead chicken that floated with its yellowy reptilian toes pointed at the dripping ceiling then at some junction east of town the chicken was swept off to the left while Georges boat went straight
An hour later while Georges mother was being sedated in the Emergency Room at Derry Home Hospital and while Stuttering Bill sat stunned and white and silent in his bed listening to his father sob hoarsely in the parlor where his mother had been playing Für Elise when George went out the boat shot out through a concrete loophole like a bullet exiting the muzzle of a gun and ran at speed down a sluiceway and into an unnamed stream When it joined the boiling swollen Penobscot River twenty minutes later the first rifts of blue had begun to show in the sky overhead The storm was over
The boat dipped and swayed and sometimes took on water but it did not sink the two brothers had waterproofed it well I do not know where it finally fetched up if ever it did perhaps it reached the sea and sails there forever like a magic boat in a fairytale All I know is that it was still afloat and still running on the breast of the flood when it passed the incorporated town limits of Derry Maine and there it passes out of this tale forever
CHAPTER 2
After the Festival 1984
1
The reason Adrian was wearing the hat his sobbing boyfriend would later tell the police was because he had won it at the Pitch Til U Win stall on the Bassey Park fairgrounds just six days before his death He was proud of it
He was wearing it because he loved this shitty little town the boyfriend Don Hagarty screamed at the cops
Now nowtheres no need for that sort of language Officer Harold Gardener told Hagarty Harold Gardener was one of Dave Gardeners four sons On the day his father had discovered the lifeless onearmed body of George Denbrough Harold Gardener had been five On this day almost twentyseven years later he was thirtytwo and balding Harold Gardener recognized the reality of Don Hagartys grief and pain and at the same time found it impossible to take seriously This manif you want to call him a manwas wearing lipstick and satin pants so tight you could almost read the wrinkles in his cock Grief or no grief pain or no pain he was after all just a queer Like his friend the late Adrian Mellon
Lets go through it again Harolds partner Jeffrey Reeves said The two of you came out of the Falcon and turned toward the Canal Then what
How many times do I have to tell you idiots Hagarty was still screaming They killed him They pushed him over the side Just another day in Macho City for them Don Hagarty began to cry
One more time Reeves repeated patiently You came out of the Falcon Then what
2
In an interrogation room just down the hall two Derry cops were speaking with Steve Dubay seventeen in the Clerk of Probates office upstairs two more were questioning John
Webby Garton eighteen and in the Chief of Polices office on the fifth floor Chief Andrew Rademacher and Assistant District Attorney Tom Boutillier were questioning fifteenyearold Christopher Unwin Unwin who wore faded jeans a greasesmeared teeshirt and blocky engineer boots was weeping Rademacher and Boutillier had taken him because they had quite accurately assessed him as the weak link in the chain
Lets go through it again Boutillier said in this office just as Jeffrey Reeves was saying the same thing two floors down
We didnt mean to kill him Unwin blubbered It was the hat We couldnt believe he was still wearing the hat after you know after what Webby said the first time And I guess we wanted to scare him
For what he said Chief Rademacher interjected
Yes
To John Garton on the afternoon of the 17th
Yes to Webby Unwin burst into fresh tears But we tried to save him when we saw he was in trouble  at least me and Stevie Dubay did  we didnt mean to kill him
Come on Chris dont shit us Boutillier said You threw the little queer into the Canal
Yes but
And the three of you came in to make a clean breast of things Chief Rademacher and I appreciate that dont we Andy
You bet It takes a man to own up to what he did Chris 
So dont fuck yourself up by lying now You meant to throw him over the minute you saw him and his fag buddy coming out of the Falcon didnt you
No Chris Unwin protested vehemently
Boutillier took a pack of Marlboros from his shirt pocket and stuck one in his mouth He offered the pack to Unwin Cigarette
Unwin took one Boutillier had to chase the tip with a match in order to give him a light because of the way Unwins mouth was trembling
But when you saw he was wearing the hat Rademacher asked
Unwin dragged deep lowered his head so that his greasy hair fell in his eyes and jetted smoke from his nose which was littered with blackheads
Yeah he said almost too softly to be heard
Boutillier leaned forward brown eyes gleaming His face was predatory but his voice was gentle What Chris
I said yes I guess so To throw him in But not to kill him He looked up at them face frantic and miserable and still unable to comprehend the stupendous changes which had taken place in his life since he left the house to take in the last night of Derrys Canal Days Festival with two of his buddies at seventhirty the previous evening Not to kill him he repeated And that guy under the bridge  I still dont know who he was
What guy was that Rademacher asked but without much interest They had heard this part before as well and neither of them believed itsooner or later men accused of murder almost always drag out that mysterious other guy Boutillier even had a name for it he called it the OneArmed Man Syndrome after that old TV series The Fugitive
The guy in the clown suit Chris Unwin said and shivered The guy with the balloons

The Canal Days Festival which ran from July 15th to July 21st had been a rousing success most Derry residents agreed a great thing for the citys morale image  and pocketbook The weeklong festival was pegged to mark the centenary of the opening of the Canal which ran through the middle of downtown It had been the Canal which had fully opened Derry to the lumber trade in the years 1884 to 1910 it had been the Canal which had birthed Derrys boom years
The town was spruced up from east to west and north to south Potholes which some residents swore hadnt been patched for ten years or more were neatly filled with hottop and rolled smooth The town buildings were refurbished on the inside repainted on the outside The worst of the graffiti in Bassey Parkmuch of it coolly logical antigay statements such as KILL ALL QUEERS and AIDS FROM GOD YOU HELLBOUND HOMOSwas sanded off the benches and wooden walls of the little covered walkway over the Canal known as the Kissing Bridge
A Canal Days Museum was installed in three empty storefronts downtown and filled with exhibits by Michael Hanlon a local librarian and amateur historian The towns oldest families loaned freely of their almost priceless treasures and during the week of the festival nearly forty thousand visitors paid a quarter each to look at eatinghouse menus from the 1890s loggers bitts axes and peaveys from the 1880s childrens toys from the 1920s and over two thousand photographs and nine reels of movie film of life as it had been in Derry over the last hundred years
The museum was sponsored by the Derry Ladies Society which vetoed some of Hanlons proposed exhibits such as the notorious trampchair from the 1930s and photographs such as those of the Bradley Gang after the notorious shootout But all agreed it was a great success and no one really wanted to see those gory old things anyway It was so much better to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative as the old song said
There was a huge striped refreshment tent in Derry Park and band concerts there every night In Bassey Park there was a carnival with rides by Smokeys Greater Shows and games run by local townfolk A special tramcar circled the historic sections of the town every hour on the hour and ended up at this gaudy and amiable moneymachine
It was here that Adrian Mellon won the hat which would get him killed the paper tophat with the flower and the band which said IDERRY
4
Im tired John Webby Garton said Like his two friends he was dressed in unconscious imitation of Bruce Springsteen although if asked he would probably call Springsteen a wimp or a fagola and would instead profess admiration for such bitchin heavymetal groups as Def Leppard Twisted Sister or Judas Priest The sleeves of his plain blue teeshirt were torn off showing his heavily muscled arms His thick brown hair fell over one eyethis touch was more John Cougar Mellencamp than Springsteen There were blue tattoos on his armsarcane symbols which looked as if they had been drawn by a child I dont want to talk no more
Just tell us about Tuesday afternoon at the fair Paul Hughes said Hughes was tired and shocked and dismayed by this whole sordid business He thought again and again that it was as if Derry Canal Days ended with one final event which everyone had somehow known about but which no one had quite dared to put down on the Daily Program of Events If they had it would have looked like thisSaturday 900 PM Final band concert featuring the Derry High School Band and the Barber Shop MelloMen
Saturday 1000 PM Giant fireworks show
Saturday 1035 PM Ritual sacrifice of Adrian Mellon officially ends Canal Days
Fuck the fair Webby replied
Just what you said to Mellon and what he said to you
Oh Christ Webby rolled his eyes
Come on Webby Hughess partner said
Webby Garton rolled his eyes and began again
5
Garton saw the two of them Mellon and Hagarty mincing along with their arms about each others waists and giggling like a couple of girls At first he actually thought they were a couple of girls Then he recognized Mellon who had been pointed out to him before As he looked he saw Mellon turn to Hagarty  and they kissed briefly
Oh man Im gonna barf Webby cried disgusted
Chris Unwin and Steve Dubay were with him When Webby pointed out Mellon Steve Dubay said he thought the other fag was named Don somebody and that hed picked up a kid from Derry High hitching and then tried to put a few moves on him
Mellon and Hagarty began to move toward the three boys again walking away from the Pitch Til U Win and toward the carnys exit Webby Garton would later tell Officers Hughes and Conley that his civic pride had been wounded by seeing a fucking faggot wearing a hat which said IDERRY It was a silly thing that hata paper imitation of a top hat with a great big flower sticking up from the top and nodding about in every direction The silliness of the hat apparently wounded Webbys civic pride even more
As Mellon and Hagarty passed each with his arm linked about the others waist Webby Garton yelled out I ought to make you eat that hat you fucking assbandit
Mellon turned toward Garton fluttered his eyes flirtatiously and said If you want something to eat hon I can find something much tastier than my hat
At this point Webby Garton decided he was going to rearrange the faggots face In the geography of Mellons face mountains would rise and continents would drift Nobody suggested he sucked the root Nobody
He started toward Mellon Mellons friend Hagarty alarmed attempted to pull Mellon away but Mellon stood his ground smiling Garton would later tell Officers Hughes and Conley that he was pretty sure Mellon was high on something So he was Hagarty would agree when this idea was passed on to him by Officers Gardener and Reeves He was high on two fried doughboys smeared with honey on the carnival on the whole day He had been consequently unable to recognize the real menace which Webby Garton represented
But that was Adrian Don said using a tissue to wipe his eyes and smearing the spangled eyeshadow he was wearing He didnt have much in the way of protective coloration He was one of those fools who think things really are going to turn out all right
He might have been badly hurt there and then if Garton hadnt felt something tap his elbow It was a nightstick He turned his head to see Officer Frank Machen another member of Derrys Finest
Never mind little buddy Machen told Garton Mind your business and leave those little gay boyos alone Have some fun
Did you hear what he called me Garton asked hotly He was now joined by Unwin and Dubaythe two of them smelling trouble tried to urge Garton on up the midway but Garton shrugged them away would have turned on them with his fists if they had persisted His masculinity had borne an insult which he felt must be avenged Nobody suggested he sucked the root Nobody
I dont believe he called you anything Machen replied And you spoke to him first I believe Now move on sonny I dont want to have to tell you again
He called me a queer
Are you worried you might be then Machen asked seeming to be honestly interested and Garton flushed a deep ugly red
During this exchange Hagarty was trying with increasing desperation to pull Adrian Mellon away from the scene Now at last Mellon was going
Tata love Adrian called cheekily over his shoulder
Shut up candyass Machen said Get out of here
Garton made a lunge at Mellon and Machen grabbed him
I can run you in my friend Machen said and the way youre acting it might not be such a bad idea
Next time I see you Im gonna hurtyou Garton bellowed after the departing pair and heads turned to stare at him And if youre wearing that hat Im gonna kill you This town dont need no faggots like you
Without turning Mellon waggled the fingers of his left handthe nails were painted ceriseand put an extra little wiggle in his walk Garton lunged again
One more word or one more move and in you go Machen said mildly Trust me my boy for I mean exactly what I say
Come on Webby Chris Unwin said uneasily Mellow out
You like guys like that Webby asked Machen ignoring Chris and Steve completely Huh
About the bumpunchers Im neutral Machen said
What Im really in favor of is peace and quiet and you are upsetting what I like pizza face Now do you want to go a round with me or what
Come on Webby Steve Dubay said quietly Lets go get some hot dogs
Webby went straightening his shirt with exaggerated moves and brushing the hair out of his eyes Machen who also gave a statement on the morning following Adrian Mellons death said The last thing I heard him say as him and his buddies walked off was Next time I see him hes going to be in serious hurt

Please I got to talk to my mother Steve Dubay said for the third time Ive got to get her to mellow out my stepfather or there is going to be one hell of a punchingmatch when I get home
In a little while Officer Charles Avarino told him Both Avarino and his partner Barney Morrison knew that Steve Dubay would not be going home tonight and maybe not for many nights to come The boy did not seem to realize just how heavy this particular bust was and Avarino would not be surprised when he learned later on that Dubay had left school at age sixteen At that time he had still been in Water Street Junior High His IQ was 68 according to the Wechsler he had taken during one of his three trips through the seventh grade
Tell us what happened when you saw Mellon coming out of the Falcon Morrison invited
No man I better not
Well why not Avarino asked
I already talked too much maybe
You came in to talk Avarino said Isnt that right
Well    yeah  but 
Listen Morrison said warmly sitting down next to Dubay and shooting him a cigarette You think me and Chick here like fags
I dont know
Do we look like we like fags
No but   
Were your friends Steveo Morrison said solemnly And believe me you and Chris and Webby need all the friends you can get just about now Because tomorrow every bleeding heart in this town is going to be screaming for you guyss blood
Steve Dubay looked dimly alarmed Avarino who could almost read this hairbags pussy little mind suspected he was thinking about his stepfather again And although Avarino had no liking for Derrys small gay communitylike every other cop on the force he would enjoy seeing the Falcon shut up foreverhe would have been delighted to drive Dubay home himself He would in fact have been delighted to hold Dubays arms while Dubays stepfather beat the creep to oatmeal Avarino did not like gays but this did not mean he believed they should be tortured and murdered Mellon had been savaged When they brought him up from under the Canal bridge his eyes had been open bulging with terror And this guy here had absolutely no idea of what he had helped do
We didnt mean to hurt im Steve repeated This was his fallback position when he became even slightly confused
Thats why you want to get out front with us Avarino said earnestly Get the true facts of the matter out in front and this maybe wont amount to a pisshole in the snow Isnt that right Barney
As rain Morrison agreed
One more time what do you say Avarino coaxed
Well  Steve said and then slowly began to talk

When the Falcon was opened in 1973 Elmer Curtie thought his clientele would consist mostly of busridersthe terminal next door serviced three different lines Trailways Greyhound and Aroostook County What he failed to realize was how many of the passengers who ride buses are women or families with small children in tow Many of the others kept their bottles in brown bags and never got off the bus at all Those who did were usually soldiers or sailors who wanted no more than a quick beer or twoyou couldnt very well go on a bender during a tenminute reststop
Curtie had begun to realize some of these home truths by 1977 but by then it was too late he was up to his tits in bills and there was no way that he could see out of the red ink The idea of burning the place down for the insurance occurred to him but unless he hired a professional to torch it he supposed he would be caught  and he had no idea where professional arsonists hung out anyway
He decided in February of that year that he would give it until July 4th if things didnt look as if they were turning around by then he would simply walk next door get on a hound and see how things looked down in Florida
But in the next five months an amazing quiet sort of prosperity came to the bar which was painted black and gold inside and decorated with stuffed birds Elmer Curties brother had been an amateur taxidermist who specialized in birds and Elmer had inherited the stuff when he died Suddenly instead of drawing sixty beers and pouring maybe twenty drinks a night Elmer was drawing eighty beers and pouring a hundred drinks  a hundred and twenty  sometimes a hundred and sixty
His clientele was young polite almost exclusively male Many of them dressed outrageously but those were years when outrageous dress was still almost the norm and Elmer Curtie did not realize that his patrons were just about almost exclusively gay until 1981 or so If Derry residents had heard him say this they would have laughed and said that Elmer Curtie must think they had all been born yesterdaybut his claim was perfectly true Like the with the cheating wife he was practically the last to know    by the time he did he didnt care The bar was making money and while there were four other bars in Derry which turned a profit the Falcon was the only one where rambunctious patrons did not regularly demolish the whole place There were no women to fight over for one thing and these men fags or not seemed to have learned a secret of getting along with each other which their heterosexual counterparts did not know
Once he became aware of the sexual preference of his regulars he seemed to hear lurid stories about the Falcon everywherethese stories had been circulating for years but until 81 Curtie simply hadnt heard them The most enthusiastic tellers of these tales he came to realize were men who wouldnt be dragged into the Falcon with a chainfall for fear all the muscles would go out of their wrists or something Yet they seemed privy to all sorts of information
According to the stories you could go in there any night and see men closedancing rubbing their cocks together right out on the dancefloor men frenchkissing at the bar men getting blowjobs in the bathrooms There was supposedly a room out back where you went if you wanted to spend a little time on the Tower of Powerthere was a big old fellow in a Nazi uniform back there who kept his arm greased most of the way to the shoulder and who would be happy to take care of you
In fact none of these things were true When folks with a thirst did come in from the bus station for a beer or a highball they sensed nothing out of the ordinary in the Falcon at allthere were a lot of guys sure but that was no different than thousands of workingmens bars all across the country The clientele was gay but gay was not a synonym for stupid If they wanted a little outrageousness they went to Portland If they wanted a lot of outrageousnessRamrodstyle outrageousness or Pecks Big Boystyle outrageousnessthey went down to New York or Boston Derry was small Derry was provincial and Derrys small gay community understood the shadow under which it existed quite well
Don Hagarty had been coming into the Falcon for two or three years on the night in March of 1984 when he first showed up with Adrian Mellon Before then Hagarty had been the sort who plays the field rarely showing up with the same escort half a dozen times But by late April it had become obvious even to Elmer Curtie who cared very little about such things that Hagarty and Mellon had a steady thing going
Hagarty was a draftsman with an engineering firm in Bangor Adrian Mellon was a freelance writer who published anywhere and everywhere he couldairline magazines confession magazines regional magazines Sunday supplements sexletter magazines He had been working on a novel but maybe that wasnt serioushe had been working on it since his third year of college and that had been twelve years ago
He had come to Derry to write a piece about the Canalhe was on assignment from New England Byways a glossy bimonthly that was published in Concord Adrian Mellon had taken the assignment because he could squeeze Byways for three weeks worth of expense money including a nice room at the Derry Town House and gather all the material he needed for the piece in maybe five days During the other two weeks he could gather enough material for maybe four other regional pieces
But during that threeweek period he met Don Hagarty and instead of going back to Portland when his three weeks on the cuff were over he found himself a small apartment on Kossuth Lane He lived there for only six weeks Then he moved in with Don Hagarty
8
That summer Hagarty told Harold Gardener and Jeff Reeves was the happiest summer of his lifehe should have been on the lookout he said he should have known that God only puts a rug under guys like him in order to jerk it out from under their feet
The only shadow he said was Adrians extravagantly partisan reaction to Derry He had a teeshirt which said MAINE AINT BAD BUT DERRYS GREAT He had a Derry Tigers highschool jacket And of course there was the hat He claimed to find the atmosphere vital and creatively invigorating Perhaps there was something to this he had taken his languishing novel out of the trunk for the first time in nearly a year
Was he really working on it then Gardener asked Hagarty not really caring but wanting to keep Hagarty primed
Yeshe was busting pages He said it might be a terrible novel but it was no longer going to be a terrible unfinished novel He expected to finish it by his birthday in October Of course he didnt know what Derry was really like He thought he did but he hadnt been here long enough to get a whiff of the real Derry I kept trying to tell him but he wouldnt listen
And whats Derry really like Don Reeves asked
Its a lot like a dead strumpet with maggots squirming out of her cooze Don Hagarty said
The two cops stared in silent amazement
Its a bad place Hagarty said Its a sewer You mean you two guys dont know that You two guys have lived here all of your lives and you dont know that
Neither of them answered After a little while Hagarty went on

Until Adrian Mellon entered his life Don had been planning to leave Derry He had been there for three years mostly because he had agreed to a longterm lease on an apartment with the worlds most fantastic riverview but now the lease was almost up and Don was glad No more long commute back and forth to Bangor No more weird vibesin Derry he once told Adrian it always felt like thirteen oclock Adrian might think Derry was a great place but it scared Don It was not just the towns tightly homophobic attitude an attitude as clearly expressed by the towns preachers as by the graffiti in Bassey Park but that was one thing he had been able to put his finger on Adrian had laughed
Don every town in America has a contingent that hates the gayfolk he said Dont tell me you dont know that This is after all the era of Ronnie Moron and Phyllis Housefly
Come down to Bassey Park with me Don had replied after seeing that Adrian really meant what he was sayingand what he was really saying was that Derry was no worse than any other fairsized town in the hinterlands I want to show you something my love
They drove to Bassey Parkthis had been in midJune about a month before Adrians murder Hagarty told the cops He took Adrian into the dark vaguely unpleasantsmelling shadows of the Kissing Bridge He pointed out one of the graffiti Adrian had to strike a match and hold it below the writing in order to read it
SHOW ME YOUR COCK QUEER AND ILL CUT IT OFF YOU
I know how people feel about gays Don said quietly I got beaten up at a truckstop in Dayton when I was a teenager some fellows in Portland set my shoes on fire outside of a sandwich shop while this fatassed old cop sat inside his cruiser and laughed Ive seen a lot    but Ive never seen anything quite like this Look over here Check it out
Another match revealed STICK NAILS IN EYES OF ALL FAGOTS FOR GOD
Whoever writes these little homilies has got a case of the deepdown crazies Id feel better if I thought it was just one person one isolated sickie but  Don swept his arm vaguely down the length of the Kissing Bridge Theres a lot of this stuff  and I just dont think one person did it all Thats why I want to leave Derry Ade Too many places and too many people seem to have the deepdown crazies
Well wait until I finish my novel okay Please October I promise no later The airs better here
He didnt know it was the water he was going to have to watch out for Don Hagarty said bitterly
10
Tom Boutillier and Chief Rademacher leaned forward neither of them speaking Chris Unwin sat with his head down talking monotonously to the floor This was the part they wanted to hear this was the part that was going to send at least two of these assholes to Thomaston
The fair wasnt no good Unwin said They was already takin down all the bitchin rides you know like the Devil Dish and the Parachute Drop They already had a sign on the Bumper Cars that said closed Wasnt nothing open but baby rides So we went down by the games and Webby saw the Pitch Til U Win and he paid fifty cents and he seen that hat the queer was wearing and he pitched at that but he kept missing it and every time he missed he got more in a bad mood you know And Stevehes the guy who usually goes around saying mellow out like mellow out this and mellow out that and why dont you fuckin mellow out you know Only he was in a real pissuparope mood because he took this pill you know I dont know what kind of a pill A red pill Maybe it was even legal But he keeps after Webby until I thought Webby was gonna hit him you know He goes You cant even win that queers hat You must be really wasted if you cant even win that queers hat So finally the lady gives im a prize even though the ring wasnt over it cause I think she wanted to get rid of us I dont know Maybe she didnt But I think she did It was this noisemaker thing you know You blow it and it puffs up and unrolls and makes a noise like a fart you know I used to have one of those I got it for Halloween or New Years or some fuckin holiday I thought it was pretty good only I lost it Or maybe somebody hawked it out of my pocket in the fuckin playyard at school you know So then the fairs closin and were walkin out and Steves still on Webby about not bein able to win that queers hat you know and Webby aint sayin much and I know thats a bad sign but I was pretty faced you know So I knew I ought to like change the subject only I couldnt think of no subject you know So when we get into the parkin lot Steve says Where you want to go Home And Webby goes Lets cruise by the Falcon first and see if that queers around
Boutillier and Rademacher exchanged a glance Boutillier raised a single finger and tapped it against his cheek although this doofus in the engineer boots didnt know it he was now talking about firstdegree murder
So I goes no I gotta get home and Webby goes You scared to go by that queerbar And I go Fuck no And Steves still high or something and he says Lets go grease some queermeat Lets go grease some queermeat Lets go grease   
11
The timing was just right enough so that things worked out wrong for everyone Adrian Mellon and Don Hagarty came out of the Falcon after two beers walked up past the bus station and then linked hands Neither of them thought about it it was just something they did It was tentwenty They reached the corner and turned left
The Kissing Bridge was almost half a mile upriver from here they meant to cross Main Street Bridge which was much less picturesque The Kenduskeag was summerlow no more than four feet of water sliding listlessly around the concrete pilings
When the Duster drew abreast of them Steve Dubay had spotted the two of them coming out of the Falcon and gleefully pointed them out they were on the edge of the span
Cut in Cut in Webby Garton screamed The two men had just passed under a streetlight and he had spotted the fact that they were holding hands This infuriated him  but not as much as the hat infuriated him The big paper flower was nodding crazily this way and that Cut in goddammit
And Steve did
Chris Unwin would deny active participation in what followed but Don Hagarty told a different story He said that Garton was out of the car almost before it stoppedand that the other two quickly followed There was talk Not good talk There was no attempt at flippancy or false coquetry on Adrians part this night he recognized that they were in a lot of trouble
Give me that hat Garton said Give it to me queer
If I do will you leave us alone Adrian was wheezing with fright almost crying looking from Unwin to Dubay to Garton with terrified eyes
Just give me the fucker
Adrian handed it over Garton produced a switchknife from the left front pocket of his jeans and cut it into two pieces He rubbed the pieces against the seat of his jeans Then he dropped them to his feet and stomped them
Don Hagarty backed away a little while their attention was divided between Adrian and the hathe was looking he said for a cop
Now will you let us al Adrian Mellon began and that was when Garton punched him in the face driving him back against the waisthigh pedestrian railing of the bridge Adrian screamed clapping his hands to his mouth Blood poured through his fingers
Ade Hagarty cried and ran forward again Dubay tripped him Garton booted him in the stomach knocking him off the sidewalk and into the roadway A car passed Hagarty rose to his knees and screamed at it It didnt slow The driver he told Gardener and Reeves never even looked around
Shut up queer Dubay said and kicked him in the side of the face Hagarty fell on his side in the gutter semiconscious
A few moments later he heard a voiceChris Unwinstelling him to get away before he got what his friend was getting In his own statement Unwin verified giving this warning
Hagarty could hear thudding blows and the sound of his lover screaming Adrian sounded like a rabbit in a snare he told the police Hagarty crawled back toward the intersection and the bright lights of the bus station and when he was a distance away he turned back to look
Adrian Mellon who stood about fivefive and might have weighed a hundred and thirtyfive pounds soaking wet was being pushed from Garton to Dubay to Unwin in a kind of triple play His body jittered and flopped like the body of a rag doll They were punching him pummelling him ripping at his clothes As he watched he said Garton punched Adrian in the crotch Adrians hair hung in his face Blood poured out of his mouth and soaked his shirt Webby Garton wore two heavy rings on his right hand one was a Derry High School ring the other one he had made in shop classan intertwined brass DB stood out three inches from this latter The letters stood for the Dead Bugs a metal band he particularly admired The rings had torn Adrians upper lip open and shattered three of his upper teeth at the gum line
Help Hagarty shrieked Help Help Theyre killing him Help
The buildings of Main Street loomed dark and secret No one came to helpnot even from the one white island of light which marked the bus station and Hagarty did not see how that could be there were people in there He had seen them when he and Ade walked past Would none of them come to help None at all
HELP HELP THEYRE KILLING HIM HELP PLEASE FOR GODS SAKE
Help a very small voice whispered from Don Hagartys left    and then there was a giggle
Bums rush Garton was yelling now  yelling and laughing All three of them Hagarty told Gardener and Reeves had been laughing while they beat Adrian up Bums rush Over the side
Bums rush Bums rush Bums rush Dubay chanted laughing
Help the small voice said again and although the voice was grave that little giggle followed againit was like the voice of a child who cannot help itself
Hagarty looked down and saw the clownand it was at this point that Gardener and Reeves began to discount everything that Hagarty said because the rest was the raving of a lunatic Later however Harold Gardener found himself wondering Later when he found that the Unwin boy had also seen a clownor said he hadhe began to have second thoughts His partner either never had them or would never admit to them
The clown Hagarty said looked like a cross between Ronald McDonald and that old TV clown Bozoor so he thought at first It was the wild tufts of orange hair that brought such comparisons to mind But later consideration had caused him to think the clown really looked like neither The smile painted over the white pancake was red not orange and the eyes were a weird shiny silver Contact lenses perhaps    but a part of him thought then and continued to think that maybe that silver had been the real color of those eyes He wore a baggy suit with big orangepompom buttons on his hands were cartoon gloves
If you need help Don the clown said help yourself to a balloon
And it offered the bunch it held in one hand
They float the clown said Down here we all float pretty soon your friend will float too
12
This clown called you by name Jeff Reeves said in a totally expressionless voice He looked over Hagartys bent head at Harold Gardener and one eye drew down in a wink
Yes Hagarty said not looking up I know how it sounds
13
So then you threw him over Boutillier said Bums rush
Not me Unwin said looking up He flicked the hair out of his eyes with one hand and stared at them urgently When I saw they really meant to do it I tried to pull Steve away because I knew the guy might get banged up It was like ten feet to the water
It was twentythree One of Chief Rademachers patrolmen had already measured
But it was like he was crazy The two of them kept yelling Bums rush Bums rush and they picked him up Webby had him under the arms and Steve had him by the seat of the pants and    and   
14
When Hagarty saw what they were doing he rushed back toward them screaming No No No at the top of his voice
Chris Unwin pushed him backward and Hagarty landed in a teethrattling heap on the sidewalk Do you want to go over too he whispered You run baby
They threw Adrian Mellon over the bridge and into the water then Hagarty heard the splash
Lets get out of here Steve Dubay said He and Webby were backing toward the car
Chris Unwin went to the railing and looked over He saw Hagarty first sliding and clawing his way down the weedy trashlittered embankment to the water Then he saw the clown The clown was dragging Adrian out on the far side with one arm its balloons were in its other hand Adrian was dripping wet choking moaning The clown twisted its head and grinned up at Chris Chris said he saw its shining silver eyes and its bared teethgreat big teeth he said
Like the lion in the circus man he said I mean they were that big
Then he said he saw the clown shove one of Adrian Mellons arms back so it lay over his head
Then what Chris Boutillier said He was bored with this part Fairytales had bored him since the age of eight on
I dunno Chris said That was when Steve grabbed me and hauled me into the car But  I think it bit into his armpit He looked up at them again uncertain now I think thats what it did Bit into his armpit
Like it wanted to eat him man Like it wanted to eat his heart
15
No Hagarty said when he was presented with Chris Unwins story in the form of questions The clown did not drag Ade up on the far bank at least not that he sawand he would grant that he had been something less than a disinterested observer by that point by that point he had been out of his fucking mind
The clown he said was standing near the far bank with Adrians dripping body clutched in its arms Ades right arm was stuck stiffly out behind the clowns head and the clowns face was indeed in Ades right armpit but it was not biting it was smiling Hagarty could see it looking out from beneath Ades arm and smiling
The clowns arms tightened and Hagarty heard ribs splinter
Ade shrieked
Float with us Don the clown said out of its grinning red mouth and then pointed with one of its whitegloved hands under the bridge
Balloons floated against the underside of the bridgenot a dozen or a dozen dozens but thousands red and blue and green and yellow and printed on the side of each was IDERRY
16
Well now that surely does sound like a lot of balloons Reeves said and tipped Harold Gardener another wink
I know how it sounds Hagarty reiterated in the same dreary voice
You saw those balloons Gardener said
Don Hagarty slowly held his hands up in front of his face I saw them as clearly as I can see my own fingers at this moment Thousands of them You couldnt even see the underside of the bridgethere were too many of them They were rippling a little and sort of bouncing up and down There was a sound A funny low squealing noise That was their sides rubbing together And strings There was a forest of white strings hanging down They looked like white strands of spiderweb The clown took Ade under there I could see its suit brushing through those strings Ade was making awful choking sounds I started after him  and the clown looked back I saw its eyes and all at once I understood who it was Who was it Don Harold Gardener asked softly
It was Derry Don Hagarty said It was this town
And what did you do then It was Reeves
I ran you dumb shit Hagarty said and burst into tears
17
Harold Gardener kept his peace until November 13th the day before John Garton and Steven Dubay were to go on trial in Derry District Court for the murder of Adrian Mellon Then he went to see Tom Boutillier He wanted to talk about the clown Boutillier didntbut when he saw Gardener might do something stupid without a little guidance he did
There was no clown Harold The only clowns out that night were those three kids You know that as well as I do
We have two witnesses
Oh thats crap Unwin decided to bring on the OneArmed Man as in We didnt kill the poor little faggot it was the onearmed man as soon as he understood hed really gotten his buns into some hot water this time Hagarty was hysterical He stood by and watched those kids murder his best friend It wouldnt have surprised me if hed seen flying saucers
But Boutillier knew better Gardener could see it in his eyes and the Assistant DAs ducking and dodging irritated him
Come on he said Were talking about independent witnesses here Dont bullshit me
Oh you want to talk bullshit Are you telling me you believe there was a vampire clown under the Main Street Bridge Because thats my idea of bullshit
No not exactly but
Or that Hagarty saw a billion balloons under there each imprinted with exactly the same thing as what was written on his lovers hat Because that is also my idea of bullshit
No but
Then why are you bothering with this
Stop crossexamining me Gardener roared They both described it the same and neither knew what the other one was saying
Boutillier had been sitting at his desk playing with a pencil Now he put the pencil down got up and walked over to Harold Gardener Boutillier was five inches shorter but Gardener retreated a step before the mans anger
Do you want us to lose this case Harold
No Of course n
Do you want those running sores to walk free
No
Okay Good Since we both agree on the basics Ill tell you exactly what I think Yes there was probably a man under the bridge that night Maybe he was even wearing a clown suit although Ive dealt with enough witnesses to guess maybe it was just a stewbum or a transient wearing a bunch of castoff clothes I think he was probably down there scrounging for dropped change or roadmeathalf a burger someone chucked over the side or maybe the crumbs from the bottom of a Frito bag Their eyes did the rest Harold Now is that possible
I dont know Harold said He wanted to be convinced but given the exact tally of the two descriptions  no He didnt think it was possible
Heres the bottom line I dont care if it was Kinko the Klown or a guy in an Uncle Sam suit on stilts or Hubert the Happy Homo If we introduce this fellow into the case their lawyer is going to be on it before you can say Jack Robinson Hes going to say those two little innocent lambs out there with their fresh haircuts and new suits didnt do anything but toss that gay fellow Mellon over the side of the bridge for a joke Hell point out that Mellon was still alive after he took the fall they have Hagartys testimony as well as Unwins for that
His clients didnt commit murder oh no It was a psycho in a clown suit If we introduce this thats going to happen and you know it
Unwins going to tell that story anyhow
But Hagarty isnt Boutillier said Because he understands Without Hagarty whos going to believe Unwin
Well theres us Harold Gardener said with a bitterness that surprised even himself but I guess were not telling
Oh give me a break Boutillier roared throwing up his hands They killed him They didnt just throw him over the sideGarton had a switchblade Mellon was stabbed seven times including once in the left lung and twice in the testicles The wounds match the blade Four of his ribs were brokenDubay did that bearhugging him He was bitten all right There were bites on his arms his left cheek his neck I think that was Unwin and Garton although weve only got one clear match and that ones probably not clear enough to stand up in court And so all right there was a big chunk of meat gone from his right armpit so what One of them really liked to bite Probably even got himself a pretty good boneon while he was doing it Im betting Garton although well never prove it And Mellons earlobe was gone
Boutillier stopped glaring at Harold
If we let in this clown story well never bring it home to them Do you want that
No I told you
The guy was a fruit but he wasnt hurting anyone Boutillier said So hihothedairyo along come these three pusholes in their engineer boots and they steal his life Im going to put them in the slam my friend and if I hear they got their puckery little assholes cored down there at Thomaston Im gonna send them cards saying I hope whoever did it had AIDS
Very fiery Gardener thought And the convictions will also look very good on your record when you run for the top spot in two years
But he left without saying more because he also wanted to see them put away
18
John Webber Garton was convicted of firstdegree manslaughter and sentenced to ten to twenty years in Thomaston State Prison
Steven Bishoff Dubay was convicted of firstdegree manslaughter and sentenced to fifteen years in Shawshank State Prison
Christopher Philip Unwin was tried separately as a juvenile and convicted of seconddegree manslaughter He was sentenced to six months at the South Windham Boys Training Facility sentence suspended
At the time of this writing all three sentences are under appeal Garton and Dubay may be seen on any given day girlwatching or playing Penny Pitch in Bassey Park not far from where Mellons torn body was found floating against one of the pilings of the Main Street Bridge
Don Hagarty and Chris Unwin have left town
At the major trialthat of Garton and Dubayno one mentioned a clown
CHAPTER 3
Six Phone Calls 1985
1
Stanley Uris Takes a Bath
Patricia Uris later told her mother she should have known something was wrong She should have known it she said because Stanley never took baths in the early evening He showered early each morning and sometimes soaked late at night with a magazine in one hand and a cold beer in the other but baths at 700 PM were not his style
And then there was the thing about the books It should have delighted him instead in some obscure way she did not understand it seemed to have upset and depressed him About three months before that terrible night Stanley had discovered that a childhood friend of his had turned out to be a writernot a real writer Patricia told her mother but a novelist The name on the books was William Denbrough but Stanley had sometimes called him Stuttering Bill He had worked his way through almost all of the mans books had in fact been reading the last on the night of the baththe night of May 28th 1985 Patty herself had picked up one of the earlier ones out of curiosity She had put it down after just three chapters
It had not just been a novel she told her mother later it had been a horrorbook She said it just that way all one word the way she would have said sexbook Patty was a sweet kind woman but not terribly articulateshe had wanted to tell her mother how much that book had frightened her and why it had upset her but had not been able It was full of monsters she said Full of monsters chasing after little children There were killings and  I dont know  bad feelings and hurt Stuff like that It had in fact struck her as almost pornographic that was the word which kept eluding her probably because she had never in her life spoken it although she knew what it meant But Stan felt as if hed rediscovered one of his childhood chums
 He talked about writing to him but I knew he wouldnt
 I knew those stories made him feel bad too  and  and 
And then Patty Uris began to cry
That night lacking roughly six months of being twentyeight years from the day in 1957 when George Denbrough had met Pennywise the Clown Stanley and Patty had been sitting in the den of their home in a suburb of Atlanta The TV was on Patty was sitting in the loveseat in front of it dividing her attention between a pile of sewing and her favorite gameshow Family Feud She simply adored Richard Dawson and thought the watchchain he always wore was terribly sexy although wild horses would not have drawn this admission out of her She also liked the show because she almost always got the most popular answers there were no right answers on Family Feud exactly only the most popular ones She had once asked Stan why the questions that seemed so easy to her usually seemed so hard to the families on the show Its probably a lot tougher when youre up there under those lights Stanley had replied and it seemed to her that a shadow had drifted over his face Everythings a lot tougher when its for real Thats when you choke When its for real
That was probably very true she decided Stanley had really fine insights into human nature sometimes Much finer she considered than his old friend William Denbrough who had gotten rich writing a bunch of horrorbooks which appealed to peoples baser natures
Not that the Urises were doing so badly themselves The suburb where they lived was a fine one and the home which they had purchased for 87000 in 1979 would probably now sell quickly and painlessly for 165000not that she wanted to sell but such things were good to know She sometimes drove back from the Fox Run Mall in her Volvo Stanley drove a Mercedes diesetteasing him she called it Sedanley and saw her house set tastefully back behind low yew hedges and thought Who lives there Why Ido Mrs Stanley Uris does This was not an entirely happy thought mixed with it was a pride so fierce that it sometimes made her feel a bit ill Once upon a time you see there had been a lonely eighteenyearold girl named Patricia Blum who had been refused entry to the afterprom party that was held at the country club in the upstate town of Glointon New York She had been refused admission of course because her last name rhymed with plum That was her just a skinny little kike plum 1967 that had been and such discrimination was against the law of course hardeharharhar and besides it was all over now Except that for part of her it was never going to be over Part of her would always be walking back to the car with Michael Rosenblatt listening to the crushed gravel under her pumps and his rented formal shoes back to his fathers car which Michael had borrowed for the evening and which he had spent the afternoon waxing Part of her would always be walking next to Michael in his rented white dinner jackethow it had glimmered in the soft spring night She had been in a pale green evening gown which her mother declared made her look like a mermaid and the idea of a kike mermaid was pretty funny hardeharharhar They had walked with their heads up and she had not weptnot thenbut she had understood they werent walking back no not really what they had been doing was slinking back slinking rhymes with stinking both of them feeling more Jewish than they had ever felt in their lives feeling like pawnbrokers feeling like cattlecar riders feeling oily longnosed sallowskinned feeling like mockies sheenies kikes wanting to feel angry and not being able to feel angrythe anger came only later when it didnt matter At that moment she had only been able to feel ashamed had only been able to ache And then someone had laughed A high shrill tittering laugh like a fast run of notes on a piano and in the car she had been able to weep oh you bet here is the kike mermaid whose name rhymes with plum just weeping away like crazy Mike Rosenblatt had put a clumsy comforting hand on the back of her neck and she had twisted away from it feeling ashamed feeling dirty feeling Jewish
The house set so tastefully back behind the yew hedges made that better  but not all better The hurt and shame were still there and not even being accepted in this quiet sleekly welltodo neighborhood could quite make that endless walk with the sound of grating stones beneath their shoes stop happening Not even being members of this country club where the maître d always greeted them with a quietly respectful Good evening Mr and Mrs Uris She would come home cradled in her 1984 Volvo and she would look at her house sitting on its expanse of green lawn and she would oftenall too often she supposedthink of that shrill titter And she would hope that the girl who had tittered was living in a shitty tract house with a goy husband who beat her that she had been pregnant three times and had miscarried each time that her husband cheated on her with diseased women that she had slipped discs and fallen arches and cysts on her dirty tittering tongue
She would hate herself for these thoughts these uncharitable thoughts and promise to do betterto stop drinking these bitter gallandwormwood cocktails Months would go by when she did not think such thoughts She would think Maybe all of that is finally past me I am not that girl of eighteen anymore I am a woman of thirtysix the girl who heard the endless click and grate of those driveway stones the girl who twisted away from Mike Rosenblatts hand when he tried to comfort her because it was a Jewish hand was half a life ago That silly little mermaid is dead I can forget her now and just be myself Okay Good Great But then she would be somewhereat the supermarket maybeand she would hear sudden tittering laughter from the next aisle and her back would prickle her nipples would go hard and hurtful her hands would tighten on the bar of the shopping cart or just on each other and she would think Someone just told someone else that Im Jewish that Im nothing but a bignose mockie kike that Stanleys nothing but a bignose mockie kike hes an accountant sure Jews are good with numbers we let them into the country club we had to back in 1981 when that bignose mockie gynecologist won his suit but we laugh at them we laugh and laugh and laugh Or she would simply hear the phantom click and grate of stones and think Mermaid Mermaid
Then the hate and shame would come flooding back like a migraine headache and she would despair not only for herself but for the whole human race Werewolves The book by Denbroughthe one she had tried to read and then put asidewas about werewolves Werewolves shit What did a man like that know about werewolves
Most of the time however she felt better than thatfelt she was better than that She loved her man she loved her house and she was usually able to love her life and herself Things were good They had not always been that way of coursewere things ever When she accepted Stanleys engagement ring her parents had been both angry and unhappy She had met him at a sorority party He had come over to her school from New York State University where he was a scholarship student They had been introduced by a mutual friend and by the time the evening was over she suspected that she loved him By the midterm break she was sure When spring came around and Stanley offered her a small diamond ring with a daisy pushed through it she had accepted it
In the end in spite of their qualms her parents had accepted it as well There was little else they could do although Stanley Uris would soon be sallying forth into a jobmarket glutted with young accountantsand when he went into that jungle he would do so with no family finances to backstop him and with their only daughter as his hostage to fortune But Patty was twentytwo a woman now and would herself soon graduate with a BA
Ill be supporting that foureyed son of a bitch for the rest of my life Patty had heard her father say one night Her mother and father had gone out for dinner and her father had drunk a little too much
Shh shell hear you Ruth Blum said
Patty had lain awake that night until long after midnight dryeyed alternately hot and cold hating them both She had spent the next two years trying to get rid of that hate there was too much hate inside her already Sometimes when she looked into the mirror she could see the things it was doing to her face the fine lines it was drawing there That was a battle she won Stanley had helped her
His own parents had been equally concerned about the marriage They did not of course believe their Stanley was destined for a life of squalor and poverty but they thought the kids were being hasty Donald Uris and Andrea Bertoly had themselves married in their early twenties but they seemed to have forgotten the fact
Only Stanley had seemed sure of himself confident of the future unconcerned with the pitfalls their parents saw strewn all about the kids And in the end it was his confidence rather than their fears which had been justified In July of 1972 with the ink barely dry on her diploma Patty had landed a job teaching shorthand and business English in Traynor a small town forty miles south of Atlanta When she thought of how she had come by that job it always struck her as a littlewell eerie She had made a list of forty possibles from the ads in the teachers journals then had written forty letters over five nightseight each eveningrequesting further information on the job and an application for each Twentytwo replies indicated that the positions had been filled In other cases a more detailed explanation of the skills needed made it clear she wasnt in the running applying would only be a waste of her time and theirs She had finished with a dozen possibles Each looked as likely as any other Stanley had come in while she was puzzling over them and wondering if she could possibly manage to fill out a dozen teaching applications without going totally bonkers He looked at the strew of papers on the table and then tapped the letter from the Traynor Superintendent of Schools a letter which to her looked no more or less encouraging than any of the others
There he said
She looked up at him startled by the simple certainty in his voice Do you know something about Georgia that I dont
Nope Only time I was ever there was at the movies She looked at him an eyebrow cocked
Gone with the Wind Vivien Leigh Clark Gable I will think about it tomorrow for tomorrow is anothah day Do I sound like I come from the South Patty
Yes South Bronx If you dont know anything about Georgia and youve never been there then why
Because its right
You cant know that Stanley
Sure I can he said simply I do Looking at him she had seen he wasnt joking he really meant it She had felt a ripple of unease go up her back
How do you know
He had been smiling a little Now the smile faltered and for a moment he had seemed puzzled His eyes had darkened as if he looked inward consulting some interior device which ticked and whirred correctly but which ultimately he understood no more than the average man understands the workings of the watch on his wrist
The turtle couldnt help us he said suddenly He said that quite clearly She heard it That inward lookthat look of surprised musingwas still on his face and it was starting to scare her
Stanley What are you talking about Stanley
He jerked She had been eating peaches as she went over the applications and his hand struck the dish It fell on the floor and broke His eyes seemed to clear
Oh shit Im sorry
Its all right Stanleywhat were you talking about
I forget he said But I think we ought to think Georgia babylove
But
Trust me he said so she did
Her interview had gone smashingly She had known she had the job when she got on the train back to New York The head of the Business Department had taken an instant liking to Patty and she to him she had almost heard the click The confirming letter had come a week later The Traynor Consolidated School Department could offer her 9200 and a probationary contract
You are going to starve Herbert Blum said when his daughter told him she intended to take the job And you will be hot while you starve
Fiddledeedee Scarlett Stanley said when she told him what her father had said She had been furious near tears but now she began to giggle and Stanley swept her into his arms
Hot they had been starved they had not They were married on August 19th 1972 Patty Uris had gone to her marriage bed a virgin She had slipped naked between cool sheets at a resort hotel in the Poconos her mood turbulent and stormylightningflares of wanting and delicious lust dark clouds of fright When Stanley slid into bed beside her ropy with muscle his penis an exclamation point rising from gingery pubic hair she had whispered Dont hurt me dear
I will never hurt you he said as he took her in his arms and it was a promise he had kept faithfully until May 28th 1985the night of the bath
Her teaching had gone well Stanley got a job driving a bakery truck for one hundred dollars a week In November of that year when the Traynor Flats Shopping Center opened he got a job with the H  R Block office out there for a hundred and fifty Their combined income was then 17000 a yearthis seemed a kings ransom to them in those days when gas sold for thirtyfive cents a gallon and a loaf of white bread could be had for a nickel less than that In March of 1973 with no fuss and no fanfare Patty Uris had thrown away her birthcontrol pills
In 1975 Stanley quit H  R Block and opened his own business All four inlaws agreed that this was a foolhardy move Not that Stanley should not have his own businessGod forbid he should not have his own business But it was too early all of them agreed and it put too much of the financial burden on Patty At least until the pisher knocks her up Herbert Blum told his brother morosely after a night of drinking in the kitchen and then Ill be expected to carry them The consensus of inlaw opinion on the matter was that a man should not even think about going into business for himself until he had reached a more serene and mature ageseventyeight say
Again Stanley seemed almost preternaturally confident He was young personable bright apt He had made contacts working for Block All of these things were givens But he could not have known that Corridor Video a pioneer in the nascent videotape business was about to settle on a huge patch of farmedout land less than ten miles from the suburb to which the Urises had eventually moved in 1979 nor could he have known that Corridor would be in the market for an independent marketing survey less than a year after its move to Traynor Even if Stan had been privy to some of this information he surely could not have believed they would give the job to a young bespectacled Jew who also happened to be a damyankeea Jew with an easy grin a hipshot way of walking a taste for bellbottomed jeans on his days off and the last ghosts of his adolescent acne still on his face Yet they had They had And it seemed that Stan had known it all along
His work for CV led to an offer of a fulltime position with the companystarting salary 30000 a year
And that really is only the start Stanley told Patty in bed that night They are going to grow like corn in August my dear If no one blows up the world in the next ten years or so they are going to be right up there on the big board along with Kodak and Sony and RCA
So what are you going to do she asked already knowing
I am going to tell them what a pleasure it was to do business with them he said and laughed and drew her close and kissed her Moments later he mounted her and there were climaxesone two and three like bright rockets going off in a night sky  but there was no baby
His work with Corridor Video had brought him into contact with some of Atlantas richest and most powerful menand they were both astonished to find that these men were mostly okay In them they found a degree of acceptance and broadminded kindliness that was almost unknown in the North Patty remembered Stanley once writing home to his mother and father The best rich men in America live in Atlanta Georgia I am going to help make some of them richer and they are going to make me richer and no one is going to own me except my wife Patricia and since I already own her I guess that is safe enough
By the time they moved from Traynor Stanley was incorporated and employed six people In 1983 their income had entered unknown territoryterritory of which Patty had heard only the dimmest rumors This was the fabled land of SIX FIGURES And it had all happened with the casual ease of slipping into a pair of sneakers on Saturday morning This sometimes frightened her Once she had made an uneasy joke about deals with the devil Stanley had laughed until he almost choked but to her it hadnt seemed that funny and she supposed it never would
The turtle couldnt help us
Sometimes for no reason at all she would wake up with this thought in her mind like the last fragment of an otherwise forgotten dream and she would turn to Stanley needing to touch him needing to make sure he was still there
Twas a good lifethere was no wild drinking no outside sex no drugs no boredom no bitter arguments about what to do next There was only a single cloud It was her mother who first mentioned the presence of this cloud That her mother would be the one to finally do so seemed in retrospect preordained It finally came out as a question in one of Ruth Blums letters She wrote Patty once a week and that particular letter had arrived in the early fall of 1979 It came forwarded from the old Traynor address and Patty read it in a living room filled with cardboard liquorstore cartons from which spilled their possessions looking forlorn and uprooted and dispossessed
In most ways it was the usual Ruth Blum Letter from Home four closely written blue pages each one headed JUST A NOTE FROM RUTH Her scrawl was nearly illegible and Stanley had once complained he could not read a single word his motherinlaw wrote Why would you want to Patty had responded
This one was full of Moms usual brand of news for Ruth Blum recollection was a broad delta spreading out from the moving point of the now in an everwidening fan of interlocking relationships Many of the people of whom her mother wrote were beginning to fade in Pattys memory like photographs in an old album but to Ruth all of them remained fresh Her concerns for their health and her curiosity about their various doings never seemed to wane and her prognoses were unfailingly dire Her father was still having too many stomachaches He was sure it was just dyspepsia the idea that he might have an ulcer she wrote would not cross his mind until he actually began coughing up blood and probably not even then You know your father dearhe works like a mule and he also thinks like one sometimes God should forgive me for saying so Randi Harlengen had gotten her tubes tied they took cysts as big as golfballs out of her ovaries no malignancy thank God but twentyseven ovarian cysts could you die It was the water in New York City she was quite sure of thatthe city air was dirty too but she was convinced it was the water that really got to you after awhile It built up deposits inside a person She doubted if Patty knew how often she had thanked God that you kids were out in the country where both air and water but particularly the waterwere healthier to Ruth all of the South including Atlanta and Birmingham was the country Aunt Margaret was feuding with the power company again Stella Flanagan had gotten married again some people never learned Richie Huber had been fired again
And in the middle of this chattyand often cattyoutpouring in the middle of a paragraph apropos of nothing which had gone before or which came after Ruth Blum had casually asked the Dreaded Question So when are you and Stan going to make us grandparents Were all ready to start spoiling him or her rotten And in case you hadnt noticed Patsy were not getting any younger And then on to the Bruckner girl from down the block who had been sent home from school because she was wearing no bra and a blouse that you could see right through
Feeling low and homesick for their old place in Traynor feeling unsure and more than a little afraid of what might be ahead Patty had gone into what was to become their bedroom and had lain down upon the mattress the box spring was still out in the garage and the mattress lying all by itself on the big carpetless floor looked like an artifact cast up on a strange yellow beach She put her head in her arms and lay there weeping for nearly twenty minutes She supposed that cry had been coming anyway Her mothers letter had just brought it on sooner the way dust hurries the tickle in your nose into a sneeze
Stanley wanted kids She wanted kids They were as compatible on that subject as they were on their enjoyment of Woody Allens films their more or less regular attendance at synagogue their political leanings their dislike of marijuana a hundred other things both great and small There had been an extra room in the Traynor house which they had split evenly down the middle On the left he had a desk for working and a chair for reading on the right she had a sewing machine and a cardtable where she did jigsaw puzzles There had been an agreement between them about that room so strong they rarely spoke of itit was simply there like their noses or the wedding rings on their left hands Someday that room would belong to Andy or to Jenny But where was that child The sewing machine and the baskets of fabric and the cardtable and the desk and the LaZBoy all kept their places seeming each month to solidify their holds on their respective positions in the room and to further establish their legitimacy So she thought although she never could quite crystallize the thought like the word pornographic it was a concept that danced just beyond her ability to quantify But she did remember one time when she got her period sliding open the cupboard under the bathroom sink to get a sanitary napkin she remembered looking at the box of Stayfree pads and thinking that the box looked almost smug seemed almost to be saying Hello Patty We are your children We are the only children you will ever have and we are hungry Nurse us Nurse us on blood
In 1976 three years after she had thrown away the last cycle of Ovral tablets they saw a doctor named Harkavay in Atlanta We want to know if there is something wrong Stanley said and we want to know if we can do anything about it if there is
They took the tests They showed that Stanleys sperm was perky that Pattys eggs were fertile that all the channels that were supposed to be open were open
Harkavay who wore no wedding ring and who had the open pleasant ruddy face of a college grad student just back from a midterm skiing vacation in Colorado told them that maybe it was just nerves He told them that such a problem was by no means uncommon He told them that there seemed to be a psychological correlative in such cases that was in some ways similar to sexual impotencythe more you wanted to the less you could They would have to relax They ought if they could to forget all about procreation when they had sex
Stan was grumpy on the way home Patty asked him why
I never do he said
Do what
Think of procreation during
She began to giggle even though she was by then feeling a bit lonesome and frightened And that night lying in bed long after she believed that Stanley must be asleep he had frightened her by speaking out of the dark His voice was flat but nevertheless choked with tears Its me he said Its my fault
She rolled toward him groped for him held him
Dont be a stupid she said But her heart was beating fastmuch too fast It wasnt just that he had startled her it was as if he had looked into her mind and read a secret conviction she held there but of which she had not known until this minute With no rhyme no reason she feltknew that he was right There was something wrong and it wasnt her It was him Something in him
Dont be such a klutz she whispered fiercely against his shoulder He was sweating lightly and she became suddenly aware that he was afraid The fear was coming off him in cold waves lying naked with him was suddenly like lying naked in front of an open refrigerator
Im not a klutz and Im not being stupid he said in that same voice which was simultaneously flat and choked with emotion and you know it Its me But I dont know why 
You cant know any such thing Her voice was harsh scoldingher mothers voice when her mother was afraid And even as she scolded him a shudder ran through her body twisting it like a whip Stanley felt it and his arms tightened around her
Sometimes he said sometimes I think I know why Sometimes I have a dream a bad dream and I wake up and I think I know now I know whats wrong Not just you not catching pregnanteverything Everything thats wrong with my life
Stanley nothings wrong with your life
I dont mean from inside he said From inside is fine Im talking about outside Something that should be over and isnt I wake up from these dreams and think My whole pleasant life has been nothing but the eye of some storm I dont understand Im afraid But then it just  fades The way dreams do
She knew that he sometimes dreamed uneasily On half a dozen occasions he had awakened her thrashing and moaning Probably there had been other times when she had slept through his dark interludes Whenever she reached for him asked him he said the same thing I cant remember Then he would reach for his cigarettes and smoke sitting up in bed waiting for the residue of the dream to pass through his pores like bad sweat
No kids On the night of May 28th 1985the night of the baththeir assorted inlaws were still waiting to be grandparents The extra room was still an extra room the Stayfree Maxis and Stayfree Minis still occupied their accustomed places in the cupboard under the bathroom sink the cardinal still paid its monthly visit Her mother who was much occupied with her own affairs but not entirely oblivious to her daughters pain had stopped asking in her letters and when Stanley and Patty made their twiceyearly trips back to New York There were no more humorous remarks about whether or not they were taking their vitamin E Stanley had also stopped mentioning babies but sometimes when she didnt know he was looking she saw a shadow on his face Some shadow As if he were trying desperately to remember something
Other than that one cloud their lives were pleasant enough until the phone rang during the middle of Family Feud on the night of May 28th Patty had six of Stans shirts two of her blouses her sewing kit and her oddbutton box Stan had the new William Denbrough novel not even out in paperback yet in his hands There was a snarling beast on the front of this book On the back was a bald man wearing glasses
Stan was sitting nearer the phone He picked it up and said HelloUrisresidence
He listened and a frown line delved between his eyebrows Who did you say
Patty felt an instant of fright Later shame would cause her to lie and tell her parents that she had known something was wrong from the instant the telephone had rung but in reality there had only been that one instant that one quick look up from her sewing But maybe that was all right Maybe they had both suspected that something was coming long before that phone call something that didnt fit with the nice house set tastefully back behind the low yew hedges something so much a given that it really didnt need much of an acknowledgment  that one sharp instant of fright like the stab of a quickly withdrawn icepick was enough
Is it Momshe mouthed at him in that instant thinking that perhaps her father twenty pounds overweight and prone to what he called the bellyache since his early forties had had a heart attack
Stan shook his head at her and then smiled a bit at something the voice on the phone was saying You  you Well Ill be goddamned Mike How did y
He fell silent again listening As his smile faded she recognizedor thought she didhis analytic expression the one which said someone was unfolding a problem or explaining a sudden change in an ongoing situation or telling him something strange and interesting This last was probably the case she gathered A new client An old friend Perhaps She turned her attention back to the TV where a woman was flinging her arms around Richard Dawson and kissing him madly She thought that Richard Dawson must get kissed even more than the Blarney stone She also thought she wouldnt mind kissing him herself
As she began searching for a black button to match the ones on Stanleys blue denim shirt Patty was vaguely aware that the conversation was settling into a smoother grooveStanley grunted occasionally and once he asked Are you sure Mike Finally after a very long pause he said All right I understand Yes I  Yes Yes everything I have the picture I  what  No I cant absolutely promise that but Ill consider it carefully You know that  oh  He did  Well you bet Of course I do Yes  sure  thank you  yes Byebye He hung up
Patty glanced at him and saw him staring blankly into space over the TV set On her show the audience was applauding the Ryan family which had just scored two hundred and eighty points most of them by guessing that the audience survey would answer math in response to the question What class will people say Junior hates most in school The Ryans were jumping up and down and screaming joyfully Stanley however was frowning She would later tell her parents she thought Stanleys face had looked a little offcolor and so she did but she neglected to tell them she had dismissed it at the time as only a trick of the tablelamp with its green glass shade
Who was that Stan
Hmmmm He looked around at her She thought the look on his face was one of gentle abstraction perhaps mixed with minor annoyance It was only later replaying the scene in her mind again and again that she began to believe it was the expression of a man who was methodically unplugging himself from reality one cord at a time The face of a man who was heading out of the blue and into the black
Who was that on the phone
No one he said No one really I think Ill take a bath He stood up
What at seven oclock
He didnt answer only left the room She might have asked him if something was wrong might even have gone after him and asked him if he was sick to his stomachhe was sexually uninhibited but he could be oddly prim about other things and it wouldnt be at all unlike him to say he was going to take a bath when what he really had to do was whoops something which hadnt agreed with him But now a new family the Piscapos were being introduced and Patty just knew Richard Dawson would find something funny to say about that name and besides she was having the devils own time finding a black button although she knew there were loads of them in the button box They hid of course that was the only explanation
So she let him go and did not think of him again until the creditcrawl when she looked up and saw his empty chair She had heard the water running into the tub upstairs and had heard it stop five or ten minutes later  but now she realized she had never heard the fridge door open and close and that meant he was up there without a can of beer Someone had called him up and dropped a big fat problem in his lap and had she offered him a single word of commiseration  No Tried to draw him out a little about it No Even noticed that something was wrong For the third time no All because of that stupid TV showshe couldnt even really blame the buttons they were only an excuse
Okayshed take him up a can of Dixie and sit beside him on the edge of the tub scrub his back play Geisha and wash his hair if he wanted her to and find out just what the problem was  or who it was
She got a can of beer out of the fridge and went upstairs with it The first real disquiet stirred in her when she saw that the bathroom door was shut Not just partway closed but shut tight Stanley never closed the door when he was taking a bath It was something of a joke between themthe closed door meant he was doing something his mother had taught him the open door meant he would not
